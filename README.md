# pyEncryptionExercises
exercises in python for historic and asymmetric encryption algorithms, useful in education

# Supported algorithms

Please refer to the python scripts in the root directory to learn how to use the classes.

## Historic

- Skytale: "an old greek cypher" <-> "AODRECPENLGEKYHR"
- Caesar Cipher: "Caesar Cypher" <-> "MKOCKBMIZROB"
- Vigen√®re: "A secret Message", "code" <-> "CGHGTSWQGGVEIS"

## Modulo

- computes modulo tables
- finds inverse elements ("multiplikative Inverse")

## Asymmetric

implemented for numbers only

- Diffie Hellman
- ElGamal (= Diffie Hellman with messages)
- RSA
